(10 points) Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.

    (7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
        Approach 1: 
        res is list.
        n is a range.
        use for loop as n, add i*2 numbers in the list.
        print ' : ' on each number in the list.

        Approach 2:
        range is 0 to 4
        add n * 2 numbers in the list.
        iterated by the for loop, print each number with' : '.

        Appproach 3:
        make a generator function.
        whenever function reaches a 'yield', returns i*2.

    (3 points) What type of function is doubleG(n)? What is the advantage of using such a function?
        the advantage of using such a function is for simplicity. It also improve readability.
        doubleG(n) is a generator function. It improve readability and simplicity.

```
#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

```
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```

```
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```
